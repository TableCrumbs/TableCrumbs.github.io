**Caveat lector**: The hints or reasons stated here are absolutely based upon the premise that the time of Tribulation or trials is about to begin. This also means there will be different events before His appearing as well as our Hope in Christ being fulfilled. 2024 could fulfill the time for these events to start. It is, however, my objective to promote a mindset, to wake up and realize our time is short.

## Reasons the Tribulation Could Begin Soon (or Perhaps Has Already Begun)

Before giving reasons the Tribulation could begin occurring or perhaps the lesser portion is already started, it may be best to provide 2 reasons many people give why the time of the trials or Christ’s return may not be near.

### 2 Reasons Why Some Believe the Tribulation Cannot Come Yet or Cannot Be Known

**1. The gospel has not been proclaimed throughout the earth.**

- “And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.” — *Matthew 24:14 ESV*

The argument is made that the gospel must be proclaimed throughout the whole world before the end. Reading Matthew 24 carefully, you will see that the Tribulation is already underway at least by Matthew 24:9.

The proclamation does not necessarily even need our help as it will get accomplished either way.

- “Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people.” — *Revelation 14:6*

**2. We cannot know the day or the hour, so it’s foolish to try to understand when Jesus will return or when the Tribulation will begin.**

- “But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.” — *Matthew 24:36-37*

- “Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming. But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. For this reason, you must be ready as well; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think He will.” — *Matthew 24:42-44*

- Other verses: *Matthew 25:13, Mark 13:32*

We are commanded to be alert so that we won’t be surprised.

- “But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief.” — *1 Thessalonians 5:4*

For the Bride, there will be a marriage feast. The Jewish wedding feast is described:

> “A bride in ancient Israel had no idea what day or hour her bridegroom would return for her to take her to the wedding chamber. The groom himself didn’t know when he’d go to claim his bride. Only his father knew. The father was the one who would decide when all was ready for the wedding, when the bridal chamber was complete, when the fullness of time had come. Jewish bridegrooms usually came for their brides late at night, near the midnight hour. Shofars would break the silence of night. There would be shouts in the streets, and a torch-light procession which would wind its way through the town to the home of the bride. This gave her a few extra moments to make final preparations. In the Parable of the Ten Virgins, we read about the return of the bridegroom: ‘And at midnight a cry was heard: ‘Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!’” — *Source: [JewishJewels](https://www.jewishjewels.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ancient_Jewish_Wedding.pdf)*

The time for the return of Christ may be hidden, but if we watch, we should not be surprised. There are key events that help us know when the time is near.

## Reasons to Help Us Know the Time is Near

### Reason 1: The Time from the Cross of Christ Until His Kingdom is Nearly Complete

If the tribulation is 7 years, it is likely that it is 6 years prior to the 1000 years of the millennial reign. Perhaps the last year would be part of the millennium, the period of judgments poured out on the earth after Jesus has already made His appearance to some. If Jesus was crucified in AD 30, then His appearance is possibly in 2030 or sooner.

#### A Reason for the 2000-Year Mark

If we follow a non-24-hour period of time for a day, (The Hebrew word יום (yom, Strong’s #3117) means a “day,” but not specifically a twenty-four-hour period, but instead more generically like in “a day that something occurs.” — *[Source](https://www.ancient-hebrew.org/definition/day.htm)*)

Hosea’s prophecy:

- “Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.” — *Hosea 6:1-2 ERV*

Here is what was in the mind of some ancient rabbis concerning Hosea 6:1-2:

**Rashi**: (approx. 1100 AD)

> “He will revive us from the two days, on the third day He will set us up, and we will live before Him.”

> "He will revive us from the two days: He will strengthen us from the two retributions which have passed over us from the two sanctuaries that were destroyed. on the third day: With the construction of the third Temple, He will set us up. from the two days: From the two times that have passed over us. on the third day: In the third time.” — *Source: [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/)*

**Talmud** – Sanhedrin 97a:12 (approx. 57 BC)

> "Rav Ketina says: Six thousand years is the duration of the world, and it is in ruins for one thousand years. The duration of the period during which the world is in ruins is derived from a verse, as it is stated: “And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day” (Isaiah 2:11), and the day of God lasts one thousand years. Abaye says: It is in ruins for two thousand years, as it is stated: “After two days He will revive us; in the third day He will revive us, and we shall live in His presence” (Hosea 6:2)." — *Source: [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/)*

**Jerusalem Talmud** Berakhot 5:2:2 (approx. 400AD)

> "Just as the resurrection of the dead brings life to the world, so rains bring life to the world. These are all arguments that God has to be praised for rain in the prayer for resurrection during the rainy season. The first verse of Hosea clearly speaks of resurrection, the second one ends: “it (knowing God) will come like rain to us, like late rains that pour on the Land.” Rebbi Ḥiyya bar Abba understood it from here (Hos. 6:2–3): “He will resurrect us after two days, on the third day He will raise us up and we shall live before Him. We shall know, we shall pursue to know the Eternal, like morning his appearance is well-based” — *Source: [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/)*

**Gill’s Exposition on Hosea 6:1-2** quoting from the Targum (approx. 1748 AD):

> "..but the Targum comes nearer the truth, which paraphrases the words thus, “he will quicken us in the days of consolation which are to come, and in the day of the resurrection of the dead he will raise us up;” where by days of consolation are meant the days of the Messiah, with which the Jews generally connect the resurrection of the dead; and if we understand them of the last days of the Messiah, it is not much amiss; for the words respect the quickening and raising up of the Jews in the latter day, the times of Christ’s spiritual coming and reign: and these two and three days may be expressive of a long and short time, as interpreters differently explain them; of a long time, as the third day is a long time for a man to lie dead, when there can be little or no hope of his reviving, *Luke 24:21*; or of a short time, for which two or three days is a common phrase; and both true in this case: it is a long time Israel and Judah have been in captivity, and there may seem little hope of their restoration; but it will be a short time with the Lord, with whom a thousand years are as one day, and one day as a thousand years: and this I take to be the sense of the words, that after the second Millennium, or the Lord’s two days, and at the beginning of the third, will be the time of their conversion and restoration, reckoning from the last destruction of them by the Romans; for not till then were Israel and Judah wholly in a state of death: many of Israel were mixed among those of Judah before the Babylonish captivity, and many returned with them from it; but, when destroyed by the Romans, there was an end of their civil and church state; which will both be revived on a better foundation at this period of time.." — *Source: [BibleHub](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/hosea/6.htm)*

### Reason 2: Restoration of Israel in the Land – May 14, 1948

- "And He told them a parable: 'Look at the fig tree and all the trees: as soon as they put forth leaves, you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near. So you too, when you see these things happening, recognize that the kingdom of God is near. Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.'" — *Luke 21:29-33 NASB*

The fig tree is always a symbol of a portion of Israel – specifically the area of Judah. Judah encompasses Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. The rest of Israel would be representative of the vine (*Judges 9:8-12*). Throughout the years, scholars have used different interpretations as to what this parable represents. The fig tree mentioned first is something that we should direct our attention to, as it is having leaves.

- *Luke 13:6* – Jesus mentions finding a fig tree without any figs – it is cursed.

From AD 70, when the Romans completely destroyed Israel, to 1948 (or 1878 years), there was no Israel, and now that Israel was restored in the land, many see this as fulfillment of Bible prophecy. If even a portion of the fig tree starts budding again:

- **Example 1**: Sanhedrin being re-established 2004 — [Source](http://www.thesanhedrin.org)

- **Example 2**: Full preparation for the 3rd temple — [Source 1](https://templemountfaithful.org/) and [Source 2](https://www.israel365news.com/73287/school-year-begins-for-third-temple-priests/)

- **Example 3**: Kohen Gadol (High Priest) has been selected 2016 — [Source](https://www.israel365news.com/74772/sanhedrin-appoints-high-priest-preparation-third-temple/)

- **Example 4**: Potential supply for a red heifer for sacrifice 2022 — [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHNNitEE_yk)

If the beginning and growth of Israel is a sign, and this sign started in 1948, and a generation lifespan is 70-80 years (*Psalm 90:10*), then the events that will take place will happen soon. The events in Luke 21 could happen in 2024. Taking the median number of 75-80 + 1948 = 2023-2028.

### Reason 3: Near the End of 2022 is the End of a 7th Year Called a Shemita Year Cycle

- October 2022 until 2029 is the next 7-year Shemita cycle. — [Source](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/538797/jewish/When-is-the-next-Sabbatical-year.htm)

- Also stated is that he believes it will be the last Jubilee and will usher in the Messiah. — [Source](https://www.israel365news.com/265196/prominent-mystic-next-year-will-be-the-final-jubilee-year-of-messiahs-arrival/)

The Sabbatical cycle does seem to closely mirror the time of what might be the tribulation along with the possibility of a Jubilee year following after, which could have additional prophetic warnings.

### Reason 4: 12th Imam or Mahdi Belief in Islam

Many of those mentioning the Mahdi do not give a time for his revealing, but several sites say it appears soon, within no more than a few years.

> “Therefore in total we have 7, 9 and 11 years from now based on the numbers given to us by the Prophet (saws) or 2023, 2025 or 2027AD, the later we see him the later we will see Isa (as).” — *Source: [Ghayb](https://ghayb.com/2015/12/when-will-we-see-imam-mahdi-ra-and-isa-as/)*

A world leader calling himself the Mahdi could quickly unite Islam in a super Caliphate and be an anti-tolerant force against other religions and Jews. — *Additional Information*: [The Rise of Caliphates](https://www.ict.org.il/Article/1297/The-Rise-of-Caliphates#gsc.tab=0)

- "˹Remember, O Prophet,˺ when your Lord revealed to the angels, 'I am with you. So make the believers stand firm. I will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers. So strike their necks and strike their fingertips.'" — *Surah 8:12 Koran*

- "Then I saw thrones and seated on them were those who had been given authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. These had not worshiped the beast or his image and had refused to receive his mark on their forehead or hand. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years." — *Revelation 20:4*

### Reason 5: Ezekiel and Daniel Events

- "Son of man, set thy face unto Gog, of the land of Magog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy concerning him" — *Ezekiel 38:2 YLT*

- "After many days you will be summoned; in the latter years you will come to a land restored from the ravages of war, with many peoples gathered on the mountains of Israel that had long been in ruins. Its people were brought out from the peoples, and all of them will be living securely. You will advance; you will come like a storm. You will be like a cloud covering the earth, you, all your troops, and the many other peoples with you." — *Ezekiel 38:8-9 NET*

It’s likely this prince of Rosh is Russia. Russia and some nearby allies will advance upon Israel. — *Source*: [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/04/27/russia-putin-next-move-syria-00028041)

What’s interesting about Syria is that it was the country of the north in *Daniel 11:15* and is likely the same in the future predicted in verse 40 and following.

- "And at the time of the end, push himself forward with him doth a king of the south, and storm against him doth a king of the north, with chariot, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he hath come in to the lands, and hath overflowed, and passed over, and hath come into the desirable land, and many do stumble, and these escape from his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the sons of Ammon." — *Daniel 11:40-41 YLT*

The attack upon Israel will happen, the desirable land or in some versions the beautiful land. I also believe horsemen and chariot was probably the best Hebrew word at the time for a distant armies military and landcraft.

### Reason 6: Scoffers

- "knowing this first, that in the last days mockers shall come with mockery, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation." — *2 Peter 3:3-4 ERV*

### Reason 7: Inflation Among Grains Like Wheat and Barley

The first two seals are broken and then the third seal is famine.

- “Then I heard something like a voice from among the four living creatures saying, 'A quart of wheat will cost a day’s pay and three quarts of barley will cost a day’s pay. But do not damage the olive oil and the wine!'” — *Revelation 6:6 NET2*

Grain is already rising, and with the lack of Russian and Ukraine exports of grain and fertilizer, prices will surely suffer. Additional war, drought, famine, and inflation will continue to influence prices.
