description: Analyzing why the crucifixion of Jesus likely occurred in AD 30 based on biblical prophecy and historical evidence.

The date of Jesus’ crucifixion holds significant importance, not just historically but also prophetically, as it may provide insight into His return. Using **Daniel 9:24-26**, we can calculate the fulfillment of the prophecy detailing **69 periods of 7** since Nehemiah’s commission to rebuild the temple in **444 BC**:

### Biblical Basis: Daniel’s Prophecy
The prophecy in **Daniel 9:24-26** states:

> *“Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy Place. Know and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven ‘sevens,’ and sixty-two ‘sevens.’”* (Daniel 9:24-25, NIV)

Here, **“seventy weeks”** refers to 70 periods of 7 years each, totaling 490 years. The prophecy highlights a division: **69 periods of 7 (483 years)** until the Anointed One comes.

### Calculating the Prophetic Timeline
1. **69 periods of 7 = 483 years**
2. Adjusting from **lunar years** (Jewish calendar) to **solar years**:
   - \( 483 \times 0.985 = 475.76 \)
3. Accounting for the absence of a year zero:
   - \( 444 - 1 + 475.76 = AD 30 \)

This calculation places the fulfillment of the prophecy in **AD 30**, aligning with historical evidence of the crucifixion.

### Supporting Evidence from Passover Dates
The Passover, celebrated on **Nisan 14**, is critical to dating the crucifixion. According to **John 19:14**, the crucifixion took place on the "day of preparation" for the Passover:

> *“It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon. ‘Here is your king,’ Pilate said to the Jews.”* (John 19:14, NIV)

Astronomical data confirms that **Nisan 14** fell on a **Wednesday** in **AD 30**, making it the only feasible year for the crucifixion between **AD 28 and AD 33**.

### Why This Matters
Understanding the crucifixion date is more than a historical exercise—it deepens our appreciation of prophecy’s precision. Jesus Himself emphasized the fulfillment of Scripture:

> *“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.”* (Matthew 5:17, NIV)

By identifying the crucifixion in **AD 30**, we can marvel at how prophecy, history, and God’s divine plan align perfectly. This study also encourages us to remain watchful, as Jesus taught:

> *“So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect Him.”* (Matthew 24:44, NIV)
