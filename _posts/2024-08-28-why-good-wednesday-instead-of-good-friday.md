**Possible Order of Events from Crucifixion Until Resurrection: Matching Timeline**

### Matthew 28:1 – Two Sabbaths
- Greek: it's plural ‘σαββατων’ (regular Sabbath and High Sabbath – Passover/Unleavened bread)

### Nisan 14th – (Wed) 
- Jesus was placed on the cross. The Passover Lamb was killed (PESACH).
- **Deut. 16:6** – Lamb was killed at the going down of the sun. 
  - When did Jesus die? When it was dark. 
  - **Mark 15:33** – “When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.” Then Jesus died.
  - The veil was torn: **Mark 15:38** – “And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.”
  - **Question**: If all the lambs were being slaughtered in the temple at that time, and the veil was torn – would they still be slaughtered? What did the temple priests do?

### Nisan 15th – (Thur)
- Jesus placed in the grave. 
- Unleavened bread (hidden piece of bread). 
- **Hidden Matzo** – see link: [https://www.chosenpeople.com/what-is-the-afikomen/](https://www.chosenpeople.com/what-is-the-afikomen/)

### Nisan 16th – (Fri) 
- Women went to buy spices to anoint His body (first day that markets were open since He died).
  - **Mark 16:1 BBE** – “And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of James, and Salome, got spices, so that they might come and put them on Him.”
- A High Sabbath or festival feast is also called a Sabbath during any day of the week. 
- **Luke 23:55-56** – “The women who had come with Him from Galilee followed along and observed the tomb and how His body was placed. Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.”
- **Luke 24:1 BSB** – “On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.”
- There were two Sabbaths if you read carefully, so more than two nights in the grave.

### Nisan 17th – (Sat)
- Sabbath and day of First Fruits. 
- Jesus rose at the end of the Sabbath (evening) just prior to the first day Sunday. He was presented as the First-fruit.
- **Matthew 28:1** – “After the Sabbath(s), at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.”
  - **Question**: When did the first day of the week start in Jewish perspective? 
  - **Answer**: Saturday night, but here the women came as soon as the sun was rising.

### Nisan 18th – (Sun)
- The grave was empty.
